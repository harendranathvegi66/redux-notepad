# redux-notepad-MannyHenri
A small redux practice project by Manny Henri. It is a simple Notepad. You can add and remove notes and travel back in time! 

### Who can benefit
If you are a beginner and do not know how your react app integrates with redux and gets the states and actions from the store then this might be a good starting point.
